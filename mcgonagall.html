    <h1>Professor McGonagall's Warning</h1>
    <img src="assets/mcgonagall.jpg" alt="Professor McGonagall" width="500">
    <p>You take the note to Professor McGonagall, hoping she will provide answers. She examines it carefully, her face growing stern.</p>
    <p><em>"This is dangerous information. You must not pursue this any further,"</em> she warns. <em>"Whatever lies beneath Hogwarts should remain undisturbed."</em></p>
    <p>But you can't shake the feeling that she knows more than sheâ€™s letting on.</p>
    
    <p>What do you do next?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="ignore_warning.html">Ignore her warning and continue investigating</a> (But you risk getting expelled!)</li>
        <li><a href="follow_advice.html">Follow her advice and abandon the search</a> (Is it worth risking everything?)</li>
    </ul>

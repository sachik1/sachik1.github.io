    <p>Late at night, you and your friend sneak into the restricted section of the library. By the light of your wands, you search through ancient scrolls and forbidden books.</p>
    <p>Finally, you find an old parchment detailing a **hidden chamber** beneath Hogwarts. But before you can read further, you hear footsteps approaching.</p>
    <p>Panicked, you grab the parchment and run. The next day, you decipher the clues and follow the hidden path...</p>
    <p><strong>You have risked everything and uncovered the secret location!</strong></p>
    <p><em>The End.</em></p>

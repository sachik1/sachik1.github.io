      A glitch is an intentional, sometimes accidental, distortion of digital images to display a message.
      The images are a series of pictures that represent the present and future of America.
      The images are all glitched because America is divided, which is demonstrated by the American Flag
      and Great Seal of the US being divided. There is also a shadow over the dollar bill to foreshadow that we, as a nation, may not be heading in the right direction.

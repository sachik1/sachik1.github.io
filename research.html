    <p>You and your friend head to the Hogwarts library, searching through ancient texts and forgotten tomes. After hours of research, you find a reference to a hidden chamber beneath the castle.</p>
    <p>It seems only a powerful spell can reveal the entrance. You practice the incantation and, later that night, head to the location described.</p>
    <p>As you speak the words, the ground trembles and a hidden staircase appears...</p>
    <p><strong>Congratulations! You have uncovered the entrance to the hidden chamber.</strong></p>
    <p><em>The End.</em></p>

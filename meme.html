    <p>
      I created a meme that demonstrates what almost all college students go through at some point or another.
      It is just a regular classroom setting where it seems like everyone else is really put together, and then sometimes it feels like you are the only one who is confused.
      I used the scared cat emoji because I really like the cat memes that are popular on the internet right now.

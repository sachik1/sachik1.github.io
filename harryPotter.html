        <strong>Harry Potter</strong> is the central character of the Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling. 
        He is known as <em>"The Boy Who Lived"</em> after surviving the killing curse from Lord Voldemort, the most feared dark wizard of all time. 
        Orphaned as a baby, Harry was raised by his neglectful aunt and uncle, unaware of his magical heritage until his 11th birthday, 
        when he received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

    <h1>Harry Potter: The Forbidden Task</h1>
    <img src="assets/harryPotterFilm.jpg" alt="Harry Potter Scene" width="400">
    <p>You are a <strong>fifth-year Hogwarts student</strong>, and during your time at school, you've discovered a <strong>mysterious note</strong> hidden inside an old library book. The note hints at a <strong>forbidden secret</strong> hidden somewhere deep within the castleâ€”one that could change the fate of Hogwarts forever.</p>
    <p>You open the old book, and the note reads:<br><em>"The truth lies beneath the castle, but only the brave shall find it."</em></p>
    <p>You have three choices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="mcgonagall.html">Tell a professor about the note</a> (McGonagall might have answers, but will she stop you?)</li>
        <li><a href="friend.html">Show the note to your best friend</a> (A trusted ally might help you decode it.)</li>
        <li><a href="alone.html">Keep it a secret and investigate alone</a> (No one else can interfere, but it might be risky.)</li>
    </ul>
</body>

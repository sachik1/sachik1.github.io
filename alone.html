    <p>You decide to keep the note a secret and investigate alone. Late at night, you sneak through the dimly lit corridors of Hogwarts, following the cryptic clues.</p>
    <p>Eventually, you come across an <strong>ancient, locked door</strong> deep in the dungeons. The air feels heavy with magic.</p>
    <p>What do you do next?</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="spell.html">Try casting Alohomora to unlock the door</a> (A simple unlocking spell might work.)</li>
        <li><a href="runes.html">Search the walls for hidden runes or switches</a> (Maybe there's a magical mechanism.)</li>
    </ul>
